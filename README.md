Write a program in Python 2.7 using IDLE that demonstrates the following concepts:

Use comments in your program to denote where you demonstrate each step. If there are any concepts you are not able to demonstrate, research them online first. If you still have trouble, ask an Instructor for assistance. 

1. Assign an integer to a variable

2. Assign a string to a variable

10. Create a list and iterate through that list using a for loop to print each item out on a new line

11. Create a tuple and iterate through it using a for loop to print each item out on a new line

12. Define a function that returns a string variable

13. Call the function you defined above and print the result to the shell
